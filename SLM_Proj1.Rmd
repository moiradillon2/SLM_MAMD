We will be analyzing The Lahman Baseball Database, available on R. This database includes pitching, hitting, and fielding stats for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016. This dataset is the largest available for baseball statistics. Specifically, this data set includes information on batting, pitching, fielding, all-star statistics, hall of fame, managers, teams, batting, pitching, and fielding in the post season, franchises, managers, salaries, awards, school history, in addition to a handful of other factors. 

Specifically, we will be analyzing players salaries and awards and stastitics for batting & fielding during regular and post season. We are interested in the relationship between playing statistics (batting & fielding) and recognition of success (awards & salaries), specifically how this may change over time. We are also interested in analyzing birth month & playing statistics, as Malcolm Gladwell suggests in \textit{Outliers} that players born earlier in the calender year tend to be more likely to reach the professional level.
